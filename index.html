            <img style="float:right; margin: 0px 0px 30px 30px;" src="assets/My Picture.jpeg" width="350px">
            <p>I was born on July 8th, 1988, in Morelos, Mexico. I was 11 years old when I came to the US.
                I am now a mommy of two,<a href="index4.html"> Isabela </a> and <a href="index3.html"> Santiago
                </a>. I enojoy photography, dancing, drawing and anything that allows me to be creative.
                My favorite subjects are math, art and history.
                I am currently working as an insurnace agent, at a State Farm agency. But I am more than ready for a
                change. I feel very lucky to have been accepted to Pursuit and be a fellow of the 5.0 cohort.
